# Guesstimate

Guesstimate is a simple play to earn blockchain based game.

It implements the protocol of the Chainlink Oracle, for generating randomness unto the smart contract.

Players simply guess a color against what random color the contract would pick. The contract automatically sends ether to the whoever guesses correctly, and also provides a mintable NFT to the respective addresses.
